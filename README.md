# About

This project is my submission for ICT Brandsdistribution test. The app is a simple Pokédex app, limited to the 1st gen
(Kanto region), aka the first 151 Pokémons. The API used are from pokéapi.co. Of course, all throughout the application,
cases where the API returned infos on next-generation Pokémons (not present in gen1 and thus in this app) were
properly handled.
